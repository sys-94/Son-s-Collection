  <P>Last night I cried for the first time in years
  <br>I feel like I've died
  <br>And I can't feel my tears
  <br>Restless I'm lonely
  <br>My only friend is my thoughts
  <br>Regrets pushing me to the end
  <br>I miss him his smile for days
  <br>Light up this darkness in this place
  <br>I cry out hoping he hear me
  <br>Your big sister loves you dearly</P>

  <P>I keep moving on
  <br>When there's trouble
  <br>I Keep moving on
  <br>I keep moving on
  <br>When there's trouble
  <br>I Keep moving on</P>

  <p>Grand mama told me
  <br>Life was filled with ups and downs
  <br>You can choose to smile or frown
  <br>When your blue
  <br>And there's nothing you can do child
  <br>Just keep moving on</p>

  <p>I keeping moving on
  <br>When there's trouble
  <br>I Keep moving on
  <br>I keep moving on
  <br>When there's trouble
  <br>I Keep moving on</p>

  <p>I keep moving
  <br>I just keep on moving on
  <br>I keep moving on
  <br>I keep moving
  <br>I just keep on moving on
  <br>I keep moving on</p>

  <p>Got to stay strong
  <br>To help me move on
  <br>Lord you are right
  <br>And I am wrong
  <br>But Lord I love you
  <br>Forgive me for my sins
  <br>And I pray to you
  <br>You've always been my friend
  <br>You know that I love</p>

  <p>I keep moving on
  <br>When there's trouble
  <br>I Keep moving on
  <br>I keep moving on
  <br>When there's trouble
  <br>I <strong>Keep <u>moving on</u></strong></p>
